## Technologies Used

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the movies_oscars.csv data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

### Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Jupyter Notebook and VS Code to display the data and refactor code.

### Machine Learning
The dataset will be run through the ETL process to collect, tranform and load data. 
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to conduct linear regression analysis. Our initial training and testing setup include random sampling, SMOTE oversampling, and ClusterCentroids aimed to predict future Oscar nominees. 

### Dashboard
We will also integrate GitHub for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.
