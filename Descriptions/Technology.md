## Technologies Used

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will use Python to Extract, Transform and Load and perform meaning analysis over the data. We will be using the ImbalancedLearn, Pandas, Numpy, and SciKitLearn packages.

### Database Storage
We will use PostgreSQL as our relational database storage.

### Machine Learning
Our machine learning models will leverage SciKitLearn and ImbalancedLearn Python packages. Due to the oscar imbalance, we will use random over/undersampling, SMOTE, Cluster Centroid Undersampling, and/or SMOTEEN.

### Dashboard
We will leverage D3 Javascript/Tableau to create our dashboard to present our findings.
