### Project Overview: 
Our project will analyze movies throughout history. Using the datasets at our disposal, we will identify the variables that relate to oscar performance of actors/actresses/directors and writers. We will use machine learning models to help predict outcomes of the oscars and address the following questions:

- Why do certain genres outperform others?
- What factors influence movie nominations?
- What genres and production companies have the highest probability of being nominated for an Oscar at the next academy award?

### Dataset Details:
The main movie dataset was originally sourced from The Movie Database (TMDB) via an Open API. We sourced this dataset via a [Kaggle Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv). 

To further our data analysis, we sourced the [Oscars Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv) which was originally scraped from the official Academy Awards seach site.

### Reason for Selected Topic: 
Our group decided to choose this topic because the Oscar nominations/ awards ia a fairly interesting topic with a large dataset. This topic can be also analyzed further with our movie and ratings datasets.
