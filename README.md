### Project Overview: 
Our project will analyze movies throughout history, leveraging machine learning models to predict oscar nominations. 

### Questions we Hope to Answer with the Data:
- Why do certain genres outperform others?
- What factors influence movie nominations?
- What genres and production companies have the highest probability of being nominated for an Oscar at the next academy award?
