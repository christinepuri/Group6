The objective of our project is to compare different machine learning models to identify the model that yields the best prediction score. The models to be used are logistic regression, linear regression for those "nominated vs not nominated, and a decision tree/random forest model.

We will look to find the most accurate model.

Independent Vars: Genre, Production Countries

Dependent Vars: Total Oscars, Total Revenue, Total Budget, Nomination (Binary)

Due to the selective nature of the Academy, we will assess the majority population using over/under sampling in our models in order to remove any sampling bias in the underlying data.
