## Average Budget | Oscar Nominations 
    - A scatter plot could be used to display the relationship between the average budget of films and the number of nominations films received to view if there is any significant positive or negative relationship between the two variables  
    - A bar chart could also be used along with Tableau's Calculation field to form groups of "High", "Medium", and "Low" with regard to the average spending. For example, a budget of 300k - 500k would be Low, 500k - 1M would be medium, and >= 1M would be High. 


## Genre | Category
    - Amongst the categories that receive Oscar awards (Actor, Actress, Art direction, Directing etc), we will display the genres that receive the most nominations in each category. 
    - The columns of the bar chart would be divided by the categories, and the bars would be color-coded according to genres, with the number of nominations on the y-axis.

## Interactivity 
 - Creating sets that group a range of years, for example 1990- 2000, 2001 - 2011, etc would create additional dimensions that would allow a user filter by years, and observe changes in relationships between genre and category over the years.
