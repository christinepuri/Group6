## Average Budget | Oscar Nominations 
    - A scatterplot could be used to display the relationshop between the average budget of films and the number of nominations films received to view if there is any significant positive or negative relationship between the two variables  
    - A bar chart could also be used along with Tableau's Calculation field to form groups of "High", "Medium", and "Low" with regard to the average spending. For example, a budget of 300k - 500k would be Low, 500k - 1M would be medium, and >= 1M would be High.
